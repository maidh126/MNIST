MNIST Written Character Classification | Machine Learning 
Apply appropriate dimension reduction techniques for visualization of the data set. And apply kNN, Random Forest and Neural Network to classify MNIST dataset.


The dataset MNIST contains images of hand-written characters 0-9. The task is to take an image as input and determine
which of the numbers 0-9 is written in it. The dataset is an industry standard and one of the most common benchmarks
